                  Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

                    C is a procedural programming language.
                    It was initially developed by Dennis
                    Ritchie as a system programming
                    language to write operating system.
                    The main features of C language include
                    low-level access to memory, simple set
                    of keywords, and clean style, these
                    features make C language suitable for
                    system programming like operating system
                    or compiler development.

                Java has been one of the most
                popular programming language
                for many years. Java is Object
                Oriented. However it is not
                considered as pure object oriented
                as it provides support for primitive
                data types (like int, char, etc) The
                Java codes are first compiled into byte
                code (machine independent code). Then
                the byte code is run on Java Virtual
                Machine (JVM) regardless of the
                underlying architecture.
